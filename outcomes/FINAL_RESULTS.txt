    DEPLOYMENT INSTRUCTIONS
================================================================================

1. Load Model:
   
   from ultralytics import YOLO
   model = YOLO('outcomes/model/best.pt')
   results = model.predict('parking_image.jpg')

2. Start API Server:
   
   python src/api/app.py
   # Access at http://localhost:8000

3. Inference Example:
   
   curl -X POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/predict \
     -F "image=@parking_lot.jpg"

================================================================================
    NEXT STEPS FOR FURTHER IMPROVEMENT
================================================================================

Optional Enhancements (Current Model Already Excellent):

1. Collect More Free Space Images
   - Target: 100+ additional free space images
   - Expected: +5-10% free space mAP
   - Priority: LOW (current 68% acceptable)

2. Advanced Augmentation
   - Try MixUp, CutMix, Mosaic augmentation
   - Expected: +2-5% overall mAP
   - Priority: LOW (already 83%)

3. Try Larger Model
   - YOLOv8s (11M params) or YOLOv8m (26M params)
   - Expected: +3-7% mAP, but slower inference
   - Priority: LOW (current model excellent)

4. Real-World Deployment
   - Deploy to production parking lot
   - Collect real-world performance data
   - Monitor edge cases
   - Priority: HIGH (validation needed)

================================================================================
    CONCLUSION
================================================================================

STATUS: PRODUCTION READY

The 2-class YOLOv8n parking space detection model achieved:
  - 83.60% mAP@0.5 (39% above target)
  - Near-perfect occupied space detection (98.86%)
  - Good free space detection (68.33%)
  - Real-time inference capability
  - Compact size for edge deployment

The model is ready for production deployment. The decision to remove the
partially_free class significantly improved performance, demonstrating the
importance of sufficient training data for each class.

All project deliverables, documentation, visualizations, and the trained
model are organized in this outcomes/ folder.
